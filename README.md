# WisCARES-Ionic
Wisconsin Companion Animal Resources, Education, and Social Services (WisCARES) is an outreach partnership at the University of Wisconsin that provides basic veterinary medical care, housing support and advocacy, and other support services to Dane County pet owners who are currently experiencing or are at risk of homelessness, as well as those who are unable to pay for veterinary medical services needed for access to housing. To assist WisCARES with their mission, we developed a mobile application for clients to manage their pet's medical history.

Our WisCARES Veterinary Services application ran on both iOS and Andriod. It lets users record all medical issues, medications, and vaccinations for their pets. It additionally enables users save their vet's contact information. This information is saved on cloud storage to allow access to the data from multiple devices. Finally, users can find nearby resources for their pets through integration with google maps.
