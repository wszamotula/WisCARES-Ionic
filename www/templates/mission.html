	    Wisconsin Companion Animal Resources, Education, and Social Services (WisCARES) is an innovative and unified approach to providing holistic health care and housing support to Dane Countyâ€™s disadvantaged residents and their pets.</p>

	    <p>
		We recognize the benefits of animal companionship and appreciate the number of people faced with the decision of providing for their pets or their other family members.</p>

		<p>
		With partnerships between the School of Veterinary Medicine, the School of Social Work, and other social services in the Dane County area, we aim to leverage pet ownership as a method to improve access to human medical and social services, allowing the human-animal bond to thrive in situations where it may be most needed.</p>
